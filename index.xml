      <description>Hey there! I am a student who is interested in a few subjects, including technology, coding, writing and politics, and as such decided to restart blogging after my last one went down a few years ago.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting information about projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on and my opinions on current events if that interests anybody
Overall, this is worked on randomly and for enjoyment, so updates may be infrequent.
Let me know if you have any comments and feel free to email me.</description>
