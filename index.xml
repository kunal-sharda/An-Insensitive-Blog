      <description>What is Silenda? When we thought about games to implement, we initially were stumped. However, we then realized: why not let the user implement any game?
Thus, Silenda was born: a generic card game building platform. At its core, I am trying to create a simple, yet modular custom card game builder with data integrity and speed being a large part of its design.

      <description>What is Anki? Anki itself is a flash card program that is meant to make memorization easier over a long period of time.
It is said to be especially helpful when studying terms for medical school or in learning different languages, but can be beneficial in all sorts of subjects.

      <description>Hey there! I am a student who is interested in a few subjects, including technology, coding, writing and politics, and as such decided to restart blogging after my last one went down a few years ago.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting information about projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on and my opinions on current events if that interests anybody
Overall, this is worked on randomly and for enjoyment, so updates may be infrequent.
Let me know if you have any comments and feel free to email me.</description>
