      <description>Two posts in one day!?!? Yeah, I know.
New name? Yeah, we came up with a name for the project we are working (by we, I mean with my friend at his blog.
It&amp;rsquo;s a play on the words &amp;ldquo;Knowledge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Everything&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Know Everything,&amp;rdquo; which eventually translates to &amp;ldquo;Knoweth&amp;rdquo;. The application enables someone to easily, and in a scheduled manner, be able to memorize large pieces of information for a continued time period.</description>

      <description>How has progress been? Unfortunately, due to being fairly busy with my company, Scintillating, I have not had as much time to work on this project.
However, I have been working on it with my spare time - I will soon reach out to more people/the community to see if anyone is truly interested before delving deeper into graphics development.
Creating the actual functionality in Java is not too terribly difficult, and I have made good progress.</description>

      <description>What is Silenda? When I was initially thinking about a new project to build for fun, which would be a welcome break from the work that I do and the other projects that I have already started, I was a bit stumped on how to proceed.
I saw a ton of idea generators and other such things, but ultimately doubled down on something I could use myself. My friends and I play a ton of card games as I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of those reading right now do.</description>

      <description>What is Anki? Anki itself is a flash card program that is meant to make memorization easier over a long period of time.
It is said to be especially helpful when studying terms for medical school or in learning different languages, but can be beneficial in all sorts of subjects.
It has an algorithm which allows users to efficiently study certain tasks over a large period of time. From its website:</description>

##About
Hey there! I am a student who is interested in a few subjects, including technology, coding, writing and politics, and as such decided to restart blogging after my last one went down a few years ago.
I’ll be posting information about projects I’m working on and my opinions on current events.</description>
